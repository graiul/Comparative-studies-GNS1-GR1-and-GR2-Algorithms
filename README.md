    * GNS1 (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-0019-8_19)
      
      Abstract:
      
      This paper presents a new algorithm that was developed for graph isomorphism, the main goal being obtaining the correct results with the best execution times. The things described are the utility and domains of usage for the algorithm, the nomenclature, the input data, the preconditions and graph definitions, the access of GNS1 to the query graphs and the data graph, the implementation details for the algorithm structure, methods and pruning techniques, then a series of test cases, the system specifications, the acknowledgment, the conclusions and the references. Motif graph finding has gathered increased popularity due to its vast domain of applicability. GNS1 is a backtracking algorithm with new pruning techniques for reducing the search space. It returns to the user all occurrences of a query graph found in a data graph while at the same time having much lower execution times than the STwig [1] and VF2 [2,3,4] algorithms. The algorithms can be used in a multitude of domains.
      
    * GR1 (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-9885-9_7)

      Abstract:
      
      In this paper was described the GR1 algorithm that provides feasible execution times for the subgraph isomorphism problem. It is a parallel algorithm that uses a variant of the producer–consumer pattern. It was designed to easily accept and interchange different pruning techniques. The results obtained are occurrences of different query graphs in a RI human protein-to-protein interaction data graph (Ferro et al., [18], Szklarczyk et al., Nucleic Acids Res 39, 2011 [20]). This is the graph in which the algorithm will execute the search. The execution times are feasible for increasingly larger query graphs (from three up to twenty nodes) and with the included quantum computing approach were obtained superior results. The work consists of implementing and testing the algorithm in an original way starting from a simple multiprocessing example (Python multiprocessing producer consumer pattern, [28]) and then writing and adapting it for use with multiple consumer processes, undirected graphs and motif finding. There are also two tables containing the average execution times. The two tables represent two series of test cases.

    * GR2 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9559130)

      Abstract:

      In this paper is presented the GR2 Algorithm in the context of a study that encompassed elements of Parallel Programming and pruning techniques. Also there were executed circuits having 5, 10 and 15 qubits on quantum computers. For these circuits were used classical and quantum gates along with oracles and Grover’s Algorithm. The original contribution consists in highlighting the importance of Parallel Programming in classiscal computing as well as in quantum computing.
